# Lang

- object-oriented
- everything is an object
- classes
- classes are objects
    - instances of the Class class
- interfaces
- interfaces are objects
    - instances of the Interface class
- no inheritance
- class variants
    - a class can have multiple implementations
    - all implementations MUST share the same exact public interface
- no null
    - provide an Option class instead
- no exceptions
    - provide a Result class instead
- no pattern matching
    - interfaces are the only polymorphism mechanism
- no annotations
    - always use plain old objects
- no operators
    - always use methods
- no if
    - provide an `if_true` method on the Boolean class instead
    - needs lambdas!
- no for
    - provide a `for_each` method on the Iterable interface instead
    - needs lambdas!
- no public fields
    - use getters and setters
    - `attr_accessor`-like "macro"?
    - value objects?
- clean syntax
    - no ambiguity
    - braces or not?
    - explicit parameter names?
- designed with refactoring in mind
- multiple targets
    - JVM
    - JavaScript
    - LLVM
- no mutability by default

## Doubts

- how to andle mutability and side effects?
    - atoms?
    - refs?
- class/static methods?
- concurrency?
- reflection and metaprogramming?
- generics?
- covariance / contravariance / invariance?
- object literals?
- lambda literals?
- anonymous classes?
- structural subtyping?
- data/value classes?
- interoperability?
- private constructor?
